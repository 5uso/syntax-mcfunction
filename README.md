## Goals

The aim of this repo is to provide a general, feature complete language spec for Minecraft commands. It is **not** geared towards error checking or the specific commands.

- [x] Add explicit macro support
  - [x] Add macro lines
  - [x] ~~Disable quoting~~ (not needed)
- [ ] Fix issues with nbt types
- [ ] Fix issues on resource names versus keywords
  - [ ] Likely will need to combine them to some extent

## Acknowledgements

His work on the original [language-mcfunction](https://github.com/Arcensoth/language-mcfunction) and overall contributions to the Minecraft Commands community was invaluable and he will be missed.

> Rest in Peace, Arcensoth
