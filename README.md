## Goals

The aim of this repo is to provide a general, feature complete language spec for Minecraft commands. It is **not** geared towards error checking or the specific commands.

- [ ] Add explicit macro support
  - [ ] Add macro lines
  - [ ] Disable quoting
- [ ] Fix issues with nbt types
- [ ] Fix issues on resource names versus keywords
  - [ ] Likely will need to combine them to some extent
